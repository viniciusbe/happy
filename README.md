### Prerequisites

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

After cloning the repository, enter the [web](https://github.com/viniciusbe/happy/tree/master/web) directory and install the dependencies:

```
npm install

Do the same to [mobile](https://github.com/viniciusbe/happy/tree/master/mobile) and [backend](https://github.com/viniciusbe/happy/tree/master/backend) directories.
